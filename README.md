[Kafka](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/index.html) is a persistent, efficient, distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system.

[kafka-zookeeper](https://github.com/devoncrouse/node-kafka-zookeeper.git) is the original module where this is
based on, but completely rewritten and moved to coffeescript (but delivery is still .js)
